To run the program:
- Enter project root: C:\Users\LabUser\IdeaProjects\qam2 (If in Labclient)
- Run command: .\apache-maven-3.8.4\bin\mvn javafx:run
- Using the program:
-- Login using valid credentials
-- Customers, Appointments, and Reports pages
-- Customers and Appointments have on the same screen methods of creating, updating, and deleting
-- Click on a customer or appointment to pull the information into the form
-- The information in the form can be discared

My additional report was using a count of customers by location. Maybe in the future it could
contribute to deciding where a new office should be opened.
